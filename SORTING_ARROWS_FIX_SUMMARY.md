# Sorting Arrows Fix Summary

## Issue
The DataTable sorting functionality was working but the ascending/descending arrows were not visible in the column headers.

## Root Cause
The DataTable was using Bootstrap icons (`bi bi-...`) for sort arrows, but the application only has Font Awesome icons (`fas fa-...`) loaded.

## Solution
Updated the sort icon implementation to use Font Awesome icons:

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `renderSortIcon` method in `data-table.js`:**
   - Changed from `bi bi-arrow-up` to `fas fa-arrow-up`
   - Changed from `bi bi-arrow-down` to `fas fa-arrow-down`
   - Changed from `bi bi-arrow-up-down` to `fas fa-sort`

2. **Updated CSS classes in `styles/sortable-table.css`:**
   - Updated icon selectors from Bootstrap icon classes to Font Awesome classes
   - Maintained all existing styling and hover effects

### Result:
- ✅ Sort arrows are now visible in column headers
- ✅ Ascending arrow shows when sorted ascending
- ✅ Descending arrow shows when sorted descending  
- ✅ Neutral sort icon shows for unsorted columns
- ✅ All existing sort functionality preserved
- ✅ CSS hover effects and styling maintained

## Files Modified:
- `/public/components/data-table.js` - Updated icon classes in renderSortIcon method
- `/public/styles/sortable-table.css` - Updated CSS selectors for Font Awesome icons

## Testing Status:
- ✅ Sort arrows display correctly
- ✅ Visual feedback on column hover
- ✅ Icons change appropriately when sorting direction changes
- ✅ Store-based sorting integration works correctly

The sorting UI is now complete and visually consistent with the rest of the application's Font Awesome icon usage.
