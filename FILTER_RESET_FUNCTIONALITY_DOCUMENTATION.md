# Filter Reset Functionality Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the filter reset functionality implemented in the Branch Replenishment Container to ensure that all filters and states are properly reset between data loads.

## Problem Statement
Previously, when users clicked the "Load Data" button multiple times, filters and states from previous sessions would persist, causing confusion and unexpected behavior. Users expected a clean slate when loading new data.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Centralized Reset Method
A new method `_resetFiltersAndStates()` has been added to centralize all filter reset logic:

```javascript
_resetFiltersAndStates() {
  // Reset all filter states to their default values
  this.searchTerm = '';
  this.transferFilter = 'all';
  this.destinationFilter = 'all';
  this.abcFilter = 'all';
  this.blacklistedFilter = 'all';
  this.lichidareFilter = 'all';
  this.selectedReplenishmentStrategy = 'none';
  this.isSuccessiveStrategy = true;
  
  // Reset child components...
}
```

### 2. Automatic Reset on Data Load
The reset method is automatically called at the beginning of `_handleLoadData()`, ensuring filters are reset before new data is loaded:

```javascript
async _handleLoadData() {
  this.loading = true;
  this.error = '';
  
  // Reset all filters and states before loading new data
  this._resetFiltersAndStates();
  
  try {
    // ... data loading logic
  }
}
```

### 3. Child Component Reset
The reset method also ensures that all child components are properly reset:

- **Data Table**: Resets number filters and dropdown filters
- **Manipulation Panel**: Resets search term and transfer filter
- **Strategy Panel**: Resets strategy selection and successive flag
- **Quick Panel**: Resets strategy-related controls

### 4. Event Dispatching
A custom `data-loaded` event is dispatched after data loading (successful or failed) to notify other components:

```javascript
this.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('data-loaded', {
  bubbles: true,
  composed: true,
  detail: { 
    dataCount: this.data.length,
    filtersReset: true
  }
}));
```

## Filters and States Reset

### Container-Level Filters
- `searchTerm`: Reset to empty string
- `transferFilter`: Reset to 'all'
- `destinationFilter`: Reset to 'all'
- `abcFilter`: Reset to 'all'
- `blacklistedFilter`: Reset to 'all'
- `lichidareFilter`: Reset to 'all'
- `selectedReplenishmentStrategy`: Reset to 'none'
- `isSuccessiveStrategy`: Reset to true

### Data Table Filters
- All number filters (via `resetNumberFilters()`)
- Dropdown filters (destination, ABC, blacklisted, lichidare)

### Child Components
- Manipulation Panel: Search term and transfer filter
- Strategy Panel: Strategy selection and successive flag
- Quick Panel: Strategy-related controls

## Testing

### Automated Testing
A verification script (`test-filter-reset-verification.sh`) checks:
- Reset method exists and is called
- All filters are properly reset
- Data-loaded event is dispatched

### Manual Testing
A test page (`test-filter-reset-verification.html`) provides:
- Real-time filter monitoring
- Simulated filter changes
- Manual reset testing
- Data load event tracking

### Test Scenarios
1. **Basic Reset**: Load data → Apply filters → Load data again → Verify filters are reset
2. **Error Handling**: Load data with errors → Verify filters are still reset
3. **Multiple Loads**: Load data multiple times → Verify consistent behavior
4. **Child Component Reset**: Verify all child components are properly reset

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
1. Always use the centralized `_resetFiltersAndStates()` method for resets
2. Add new filters to the reset method when adding new filter functionality
3. Ensure child components support reset via their public methods
4. Test reset functionality when adding new filter features

### For Users
1. Filters automatically reset when loading new data
2. Use the "Reset Data" button for manual reset
3. Filter states are preserved during strategy applications
4. New data loads always start with clean filters

## Implementation Details

### Method Call Flow
1. User clicks "Load Data" button
2. `_handleLoadData()` is called
3. `_resetFiltersAndStates()` is called immediately
4. Data loading proceeds
5. `data-loaded` event is dispatched
6. UI updates with new data and reset filters

### Error Handling
- Filters are reset even if data loading fails
- Error state is preserved for user feedback
- `data-loaded` event includes error information
- UI remains functional after load errors

## Benefits
1. **Consistent Behavior**: Users get predictable filter behavior
2. **Clean State**: No residual filters from previous sessions
3. **Better UX**: Clear separation between data loading sessions
4. **Maintainable**: Centralized reset logic is easy to maintain
5. **Testable**: Comprehensive testing ensures reliability

## Future Enhancements
1. Option to preserve certain filters across loads
2. User preference for filter reset behavior
3. Filter state persistence across browser sessions
4. Advanced filter reset strategies
