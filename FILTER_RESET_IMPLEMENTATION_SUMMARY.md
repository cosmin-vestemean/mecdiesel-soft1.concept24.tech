# Filter Reset Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Centralized Reset Method
- Added `_resetFiltersAndStates()` method in `branch-replenishment-container.js`
- Resets all filter properties to their default values
- Resets child components (data table, manipulation panel, strategy panel, quick panel)
- Includes comprehensive logging for debugging

### 2. Modified Data Loading Process
- Updated `_handleLoadData()` to call `_resetFiltersAndStates()` at the beginning
- Ensures filters are reset before new data is loaded
- Added `data-loaded` event dispatch for testing and monitoring

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Filters are reset even if data loading fails
- `data-loaded` event is dispatched in both success and error cases
- Error information is included in the event detail

### 4. Updated Reset Data Function
- Modified `_handleResetData()` to use the centralized reset method
- Removed duplicate reset code
- Improved code maintainability

### 5. Added Data Table Update
- Added `_updateDataTable()` call after data loading
- Ensures UI is properly updated with new data and reset filters

## Files Modified
- `public/components/branch-replenishment-container.js` - Main implementation
- `test-filter-reset-verification.html` - Test interface
- `test-filter-reset-verification.sh` - Automated verification script
- `FILTER_RESET_FUNCTIONALITY_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Documentation

## Filters Reset Between Data Loads
✅ Search Term (`searchTerm`)
✅ Transfer Filter (`transferFilter`)
✅ Destination Filter (`destinationFilter`)
✅ ABC Filter (`abcFilter`)
✅ Blacklisted Filter (`blacklistedFilter`)
✅ Lichidare Filter (`lichidareFilter`)
✅ Replenishment Strategy (`selectedReplenishmentStrategy`)
✅ Successive Strategy Flag (`isSuccessiveStrategy`)
✅ Data Table Number Filters
✅ Child Component States

## Verification
- All automated tests pass
- No syntax errors in code
- Event dispatching works correctly
- Child components are properly reset
- Error handling preserves reset behavior

## Usage
Now when users click "Load Data" multiple times:
1. All filters automatically reset to defaults
2. Clean slate for each data loading session
3. No residual filters from previous sessions
4. Consistent and predictable behavior
5. Proper UI updates with reset state

The implementation ensures that între două rulări (between two runs) of the Load Data button, toate filtrele și stările se resetează corect (all filters and states are correctly reset) before new data loading.
