# Keep Only Latest Calculation - Changes Summary

## Overview
Modified the TOP ABC Analysis system to keep only the most recent calculation per branch, removing all previous calculations instead of maintaining an audit trail.

## Changes Made

### 1. `saveTopAbcAnalysis()` Function
**Before:**
- Used audit trail approach: `UPDATE CCCTOPABC SET ABC = '0'`
- Only deleted summary records for the same date

**After:**
- Completely deletes all existing records: `DELETE FROM CCCTOPABC WHERE BRANCH = X`
- Deletes all summary records for the branch: `DELETE FROM CCCTOPABCSUMMARY WHERE BRANCH = X`

### 2. `saveTopAbcAnalysisChunk()` Function
**Before:**
- Append-only strategy for chunks

**After:**
- First chunk deletes all existing records for the branch before inserting new data
- Subsequent chunks only append data

### 3. `resetTopAbcAnalysis()` Function
**Before:**
- Audit trail: `UPDATE CCCTOPABC SET ABC = '0'`
- Conditional deletion of orphan summary records

**After:**
- Complete deletion: `DELETE FROM CCCTOPABC WHERE BRANCH IN (...)`
- Complete deletion: `DELETE FROM CCCTOPABCSUMMARY WHERE BRANCH IN (...)`

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated JSDoc comments to reflect the new behavior
- Updated success messages to indicate complete removal instead of audit trail
- Removed references to "audit trail" in favor of "keep only most recent calculation"

## Database Constraints Handled
- Proper deletion order maintained: CCCTOPABC first (child table), then CCCTOPABCSUMMARY (parent table)
- Foreign key constraint respected: `FK_CCCTOPABC_CCCTOPABCSUMMARY`

## Benefits
1. **Storage Efficiency**: No accumulation of historical data
2. **Performance**: Faster queries with less data
3. **Simplicity**: No need to filter out audit trail records (ABC='0')
4. **Data Integrity**: Each branch has exactly one current calculation

## Potential Considerations
- **No Historical Data**: Previous calculations are permanently lost
- **No Rollback**: Cannot revert to previous calculation results
- **Audit Requirements**: If audit trail is needed for compliance, this approach removes that capability

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test save operation with multiple branches
2. Test chunk save operation with large datasets
3. Test reset operation
4. Verify foreign key constraints are respected
5. Confirm only latest calculation remains after multiple saves
